# PLDU-Augmented
Our augmented dataset, based on the PLDU validation dataset, simulates usage scenarios under extreme conditions such as fog, snow, bright light, and motion blur. This dataset can be used to validate the robustness of power line semantic segmentation models.

If you utilize our dataset, we kindly request that you cite our paper titled "Axial-UNet++ Power Line Detection Network Based on Gated Axial Attention Mechanism". The corresponding URL for citation is: https://doi.org/10.3390/rs16234585. Proper attribution ensures the continued development and accessibility of our resources.
